		<p>an example of building a gcp function. generating square checkout forms?
			On of the products we have at square is called Square checkout. Its an API that lets people generate checkout forms
			for people to buy things on their site. Most of the time you'll do this programatically with your site's backend,
			but what if you are using one of these new, fancy static sites with no backend? Youll need a way to get that
			checkout link from the client side. Well, you'd think that would be a quick ajax request, But, that is an
			authenticated request, so you can't do it from the client side without exposing your API credentials. Enter the
			cloud function!
