			Our team was small, but we still wanted our developers to have an excellent experience. We first thought about hiring up more people to write our SDKs, they could have expertise in each langugae, and our developers would get the best experience. But our SDKs are very active (with all those cooks), and we couldn't scale our team to handle all of the creation and maitainence the SDKs would take.
