puppeteer is a node.js library that makes it easier to run and control headless chrome sessions. It uses the DevTools Protocol to communicate between your code and the Chrome instance. You can use it do progmatically control a Chrome/chomium instance and do nearly everything that a human could when interacting with the page.
