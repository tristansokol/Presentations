		Links are an important aspect of how your website gets crawled, and more importantly, used. There are lots of thoughts about
		linking from an SEO perspective, but choose from the follwing the ones you think are most useful. * Link deeper instead
		of generic homepage/contact forms * nofollow * Not too many, not too few * Link titles, don't duplicate anchor text, add
		more context * Succinct, relevant anchor text * good keyword usage.
