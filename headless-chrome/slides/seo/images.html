		Nothing too crazy when it comes to images. Again, you want to think of your users first. Nobody wants some kind of grainy image to ever come into their view, so make sure that your resolution is correct.

		Another SEO tip is to make sure that file names you use are descriptive. If you want your image to show up when people are searching for something, but that something in the file name. Alt tags apparently have a bit less of an SEO impact, but are essential for accessibility devices, so definitely make use of them.
