exchange# How to win StackOverflow

General design based on stack overflow

* intro

  * My SO User icon
  * Where I work
    * When I started, we had effectively negative developer support. you could call up a supporter and try to explain your problem, but more often than not, the supporters didn't know we even had an API, let alone what it is, or how to help.
  * This presentation is available online, don't worry about taking pictures of the notes, there are also tons of links. notes.
  * I'll be focusing on Stack Overflow mostly as a community focused on developer support.

* The basics

  * What is stack overflow
    * A community
    * A company
  * Tagging, how to tag questions for your product.
  * "The rules"
  * Stack points breakdown.
    * [What is reputation? How do I earn (and lose) it?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation)
    * anecdote about not having enough points to comment.
    * How to farm points
      * I'm not telling you how to farm points. This is the points breakdown you get for doing so & so actions.
      * linking other accounts
        * shoe my stack exchange profile with the other questions
      * link to a meta post about farming questions quickly.
    * In summary, stack overflow is a community and if you want something from it, you should also give it back.  - **Only one way to get feedback, check other ways as well**

* not often though best practices

  * SEO
    * retagging and editing questions so that you get good SEO
    * Seeding your own questions
      - like you I spend much of my time switching between languages so I spend lots of time googling some super simple things like PHP length
    * editing questions from the past with updated info
  * Developer Experience
    - highlighting what your tag is
      - picture of support docs flow
    - Actually responding.
    - watch out for whiny babies. Like John who has asked a million questions.
  * Integrations
    * Getting Answers faster
    * RSS feeds (for slack)
    * Api (nicolas's tool)
    * Slack integration
    * Jira integration
    * Google some more.
  * Not best practice
    * people asking questions that aren't programming related
      * pictures of down voted questions .

* Datascience

  * intro/ tools
    * API
    * Stack Exchange data Explorer
    * fancy link making sql term.
  * response time
  * looking at most viewed questions
  * time/day questions asking.
  * top terms in your questions
    * squareup goshippo, it boggles the mind!?!?
  * competitive analysis
  * comparing your tag compared to question volume in a closely related product tag i.e. (algoia, javascript)
  * top answerers outside your company
  * time of day analysis/ geography
  * finding related tags
  * How many people's first questions do you have?
  * Distribution of Stack Overflow points among people who as your questions
    * be forewarned, having lots of points doesn't mean you are good at programming. You can get lots of points from asking questions as well.
