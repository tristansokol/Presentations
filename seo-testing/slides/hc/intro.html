					So first up. Headless chrome. What is headless chrome? It is not this, this clearly has a head, and that doesn't fit our criteria. That can be an easy fix, but this isn't right either, becuase this is just headless, there is no chrome. Until AI based computing paradigms get more popular, most software is driven by the user. You are the head! But this is headless chrome, chrome that doesn't need you.
