But really, what is headless chrome? Headless chrome is a pragmatically controlled, visual UI less version of chrome. Instead of you clicking and typing around, you write software to control what chrome does and where it goes, and how it interacts with websites. It is the same chrome you know and love, same rendering engines, same everything,  but it just doesn't need you.  	</aside>
