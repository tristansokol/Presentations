# How to win StackOverflow

General design based on stack overflow

* intro

  * My SO User icon
  * Where I work
    * When I started, we had effectively negative developer support. you could call up a supporter and try to explain your problem, but more ofthen than not, the supporters didn't know we even had an API, let alone what it is, or how to help. 
  * This presentation is available online, don't worry about notes. 
  * I'll be focusing on Stack Overflow mostly as a community focused on developer support. 

* The basics

  * What is stack overflow
    * A community
    * A company
    * Tagging, how to tag questions for your product. 
  * Stack points breakdown. 
    * anecdote about not having enough points to comment. 
    * In summary, stack overflow is a community and if you want something from it, you should also give it back. 
    * How to farm points
      * I'm not telling you how to farm points. This is the points breakdown you get for doing so & so actions. 

* not often though best practices

  * SEO
    * retagging and eiditiong questions so that youget good SEO
    * Seeding your own questions

    * eidting questions from the past with updated info
