          In the states we are really well known for letting people accept credit card payments on their mobile devices, giving them another way to make a sale. That was 8 years ago though.

          Since then we have helped millions of businesses of all sizes take billions of payments. and more importantly we have expanded outside of just the US into Canada, Japan, Australia and most importantly, right here in the UK.

          And as we have grown, so have our hardware. We saw merchants writing down all the items in a sale in a little notes field that you could attach to a payment, so we built them a fully featured Point of Sale. And as we expanded internationally, the US caught
          up to the rest of the world and chip cards became the norm. So we created new hardware so that merchants could accept any way that their buyers wanted to pay. We even engineer down to the custom payments chips in these devices to make sure that
          they are easiest and most secure experience for our merchants. But we aren't really a hardware company

          As we observing how buyers were using our products to accept payments, we started build other things that we knew could deliver value to our merchants in making their lives easier and growing their business. Our payments and point of sale have had a big
          head start, but we are just beginning to see some of the value created by the network effects of some of our first party services. But we aren't aren't a software company either.

          With our first Point of sale system we started building out services and models around handling things like card payments (of course) but also item catalogs, & customer management. Businesses use all sorts of different devices and platforms to run their
          business so we built components to manage them. An order can be thought of one of the smallest components in making a sale, we built out functionality for that.

          As we expanded our first party products, we continued to build more systems and internal representations of new ideas and concepts that our users. Caviar for example gave us primitives like courses and advanced inventory needs. Our functionality for appointment
          based businesses required a concept of a calendar and bookable services. We now have collection of hundreds of these concepts and primitives as data models and services available to our products. And they can only do merchants so much good inside
          of our products, but we know that the real value is created when developers are given the opportunity to meet user's needs directly, so we are opening up all of these primitives as APIs, because we know that our first party products will never
          meet the needs for every business type, size, and owner, but developers can.

          And basically what it does is transform some html we provide you into a payment form. But there is a lot more going on under the hood. Each of these form fields is actually an iframe hosted on Square's servers. At first that might seem kind of strange, but there are actually some very important reasons we do that.

<aside class="notes">
With the way we have architected our payment form when a buyer enters their card details to your website, those credit card details are actually being entered directly to Square. That creates an entire layer of security that prevents malicious javascript on a webpage from being able to access the card details.

As a developer you might find this nice because it is an easy solution that allows you to start accepting payments online without having to worry about how you are going to keep that information safe, and because you never have access to those personal details, you don't have to worry about the regulations that come along with it, like the double encryption, regular security audits, etc. We handle payments, so you can focus on your application.

        Recurring payments?
        <img class="fragment" src="img/cardonfile.png">
        <aside class="notes">
          We support recurring payments or subscription billing through our existing functionality that we call card on file in the Point of Sale world. One of the nice things there is that you can actually do switch between in person and online sales. so if you have someone who has visited your store, and wanted to keep their card on file with you in person, you can charge them a subscription online as well. Or if you have someone who saves their card to your site, you will have all that payment information and customer details if you see them in person as well.
