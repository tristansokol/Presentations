#Taking Payments with Square
The goal of this presentation is to _show not tell_ how to accept payments though e-commerce and the Point of Sale APIs. 

It was built using the excellent [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/), so many of the files come straight from that project. Everything else is probably owned by Square, especially the logo. 

* What is Square? 
* Getting developer credentials
* Creating card nonce
* Calling the charge endpoint
* Attaching a customer to a transaction
* Saving a card on file
* Adding Point of Sale API functionality. 
* Next steps
* How to get help.
