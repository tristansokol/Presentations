	But how was I going to use the tessel to start pumping stuff into google sheets? I started looking at the documentation and started reading about how I must use Oauth2, and they have flows for 1 a web server environment, 2. a mobile app on a phone or tablet, client side authorziation just with javascirpt. My tessel isn't really a fit for any of those environments. There was one flow that seemed appropriate, the  "limited-input devices" flow where I could start the flow on the tessel, somehow spit out a code and then complete the flow somewhere else, but that seemed too hard. Instead I found another way.
